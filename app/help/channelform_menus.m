% position of the head of the inlet, distance from the x-axis origin to 
% the mouth and any definition of the channel centre-line (if used).
% * *Model Constants*: various constants are defined for use in models, such as the acceleration due to gravity, viscosity and density of sea water, and density of sediment. 

%% Utilities 
% * *Hydraulic Model*: runs the CSTmodel (if CSTmodel App is installed).
% * *Add Form to Valley*: combines channel and valley grids.
% * *Utilities>Add Meander*: adds a user defined meander to an idealised 
% channel form model. After selecting a model, the user is prompted to 
% load a text file containing the x-y co-ordinates of the channel 
% centreline. These are used to map the straight channel into curvilinear 
% co-ordinates that follow the centreline and then interpolate the results 
% onto the cartesian model grid.
% * *Utilities>Add Shoreline>Model Shore*: add a shoreline strip to a 
% channel or valley model. This extends the grid seawards by the distance 
% to the closure depth specified in Setup>Form Parameters>Shore Parameters. 
% This comprises a beach profile using Deanâ€™s equilibrium model on the open 
% coast and the defined offshore bed slope across the mouth of the channel.
% * *Utilities>Add Shoreline>Extrapolate Shore*: add a shoreline strip to a 
% grid (imported or model). The user is prompted to define the width of the 
% extension, the seaward or offshore depth and an exponent. An exponent 
% of 1, gives linear extrapolation between the grid shore values and the 
% defined offshore value, a value greater than one gives a shore that is 
% concave down and a value greater than one gives a shore that is convex up.
% * *Utilities>Add Modifications*: adds defined modifications to a grid.
% * *Utilities>Add Thalweg to Valley*: uses an xyz definition of a channel 
% thalweg, to create a valley base in an existing model or imported grid. 
% This is used to modify an existing valley grid, to extend the valley 
% form down to the pre-Holocene surface (i.e. below the existing channel 
% bed) using the defined the thalweg data. User is prompted a thalweg file. 
% This has a header of %f %f %f, followed by rows of x, y, z values that 
% define the pre-Holocene valley bed. The upper and lower cut-offs must 
% then be defined.  These are used to mask out the channel in the valley 
% grid in order to introduce the new channel base (thalweg). Typically 
% values just above high water and below the deepest depth in the valley
% grid channel should suffice.
% * *River Dimensions*: calculates the river dimensions based on the
% current input parameters.
% * *Valley Thalweg*: plots the valley centre-line along the x-axis.
% * *Area of Flood Plain*: calculates the area of the flood plain.
% * *CKFA Channel Dimensions*: calculates the governing dimensions that
% would be used in the CKFA model based on the current input parameters.
% * *Morphological Timescale*: calculate the morphological timescale using
% the ASMITA model parameterisation and the current input parameters.
% * *Channel-Valley Sub-Plot*: create a plot showing the channel, valley
% and combined form as 3 sub-plots.

% * *Transgression Plots>Grid Plot*: plot initial grid, new grid and
% difference.
% * *Transgression Plots>Change Plot*: plot volume difference over the
